# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent 2023](https://adventofcode.com/)

My third year attempting the challenge. I did it twice using Ruby, this year I'll use Kotlin.
Last year I reached day 11, let's see how far I can get this year. Time is a bit hard to find 
these days, I don't expect to survive very long ðŸ˜…

## Start a new day

To start new day, run the DayGeneratorKt run configuration.:

By default, the generated folder will be the current day. e.g. if you run this command on Dec 1st, the folder generated will be `day01`
If you want to generate a day other than the current date, just provide the day in the run configuration arguments.
